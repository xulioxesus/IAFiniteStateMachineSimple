    text: "Thank you for downloading the Cartoon Capsule Pack | Lite. These lowpoly
      stylized characters are ideal to build your game or prototype. \n\nStill using the same boring capsules for your prototypes and tests? Level up your workflow with Cartoon Capsule Characters! Perfect for devs and students, this pack brings fun and personality to your projects with customizable, modular capsules. Add eyes, mouths, hair, hats, ears, and more! Mix and match to create endless combinations. Easy to recolor, quick to set up, and way more exciting than a plain capsule with a cube stuck to its face. Make your prototypes playful, unique, and full of character, because even testing should be fun!"

    text: "These characters and props are extremely light and can be used in pc, console and mobile
      games. All models share a single texture file reducing performance costs even further, allowing you to easily customize the colors just by duplicanting materials and adjusting the material offset. \n\n⚠*Many models have multiple material slots, check the <Materials> option in the [ Inspector > Skinned Mesh Renderer ] to customize materials and colors to fit your needs."
